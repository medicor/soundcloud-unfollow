# Soundcloud Unfollow
A simple app that let you connect your Soundcloud account and view all users that you are following that don't follow you back. 
There is also an "unfollow" button.

Goal was to build it without frameworks ([Web platform](https://www.webplatform.org/) only), 
although [Bliss](http://blissfuljs.com/) would have been a more pleasant experience. 
Finally ended up using [Polyfill.io](http://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js) service and, 
of course, the [Soundcloud API](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/sdks).

Currently deployed in my [Cloud](http://cloud.medicor.se/dreamstream/).

Happy unfollowing :-)
